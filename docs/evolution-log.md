# Evolution Log

## Iteration 1: zts Expert Agent Section + Design Polish

- What changed:
  - Added new "Expert Agent" section between Code and Modules showing
    agent-compiler feedback loop terminal demo
  - Added nav link for Expert section
  - Fixed section-dark alternation (Get Started is now plain since Modules is
    dark)
  - Fixed terminal pre word-break (was `break-all`, now
    `overflow-wrap: break-word`)
  - Removed code tab active panel border-left that caused layout shift
  - Added 3-column module grid breakpoint for medium screens (769-1024px)
  - Added gold accent top border on expert terminal for visual weight
  - Added scroll-triggered fade-in for pitch terminal, expert terminal, and CLI
    reference
  - Added expert section responsive stacking at 768px
- Primary metric: visitor understands the agent-compiler loop within 10 seconds
- Leading indicators: terminal demo pauses scrolling, section fits editorial
  rhythm
- Guardrails: concise feel preserved, no bloat
- Frontier note: site is feature-complete for the current product scope. Next
  frontier would be interactive demos, video content, or a dedicated docs site.

## Iteration 2: Live Proof Playground

- What changed:
  - Added a `#playground` section below the hero: a code editor beside a proof
    card
  - The card runs the real zts analyzer, compiled to WebAssembly and served from
    `static/`, so the verdict matches `zttp dev` rather than approximating it
  - Three perturbation buttons (inject `Date.now()`, leak a secret, add a
    `while` loop) flip the card red and back for visitors who do not type
  - Proof card carries four lenses: Properties, Trade, Handover, Caller view
  - Added a `Playground` nav link and a `Try it live` hero CTA
  - `main.ts`: added `wasm-unsafe-eval` to the script-src CSP and an
    `application/wasm` content type
- Primary metric: a first-time visitor sees the proof flip without installing
  anything
- Leading indicators: visitors trigger a perturbation; scroll depth reaches the
  playground
- Guardrails: the hero keeps its instant static mockup; the playground
  lazy-loads its wasm on scroll; the section degrades to a pre-rendered card
  without JS or WebAssembly
- Frontier note: the playground closes the gap the Iteration 1 note named. A
  dedicated docs site is the remaining frontier.

## Iteration 3: v0.1.1-beta Release Announcement

- What changed:
  - Added a homepage release strip for v0.1.1-beta with a direct release-notes
    link
  - Updated public version labels and download links from v0.1.0-beta to
    v0.1.1-beta
  - Refreshed the expert-agent section around the new clarify-before-guessing
    behavior and per-session metrics
  - Updated the deck version references and CLI slide copy to match the release
- Primary metric: visitors understand the new expert-agent behavior before they
  reach the install CTA
- Guardrail: no new routes, framework, or server behavior; the announcement
  stays on the existing homepage path

## Iteration 4: Lean Homepage

- What changed:
  - Reduced the homepage to five content sections and four navigation choices
  - Rewrote the hero around pre-disk proof and one primary action
  - Merged the boundary and agent narratives into one four-step write path
  - Reduced evidence and runtime copy to graded rows and one proof carrier
  - Moved technical depth into native disclosures and repository docs
  - Reduced installation to one command and the first CLI workflow
  - Removed homepage selectors that no longer match markup
  - Fixed the playground diagnostic panel hiding and pre-boot source highlight
- Primary metric: a first-time visitor can explain zttp after the hero and live
  proof
- Guardrails: the real analyzer, no-JavaScript proof preview, routes, and
  security policy remain unchanged
- Verification: Deno formatting and checks, desktop and mobile browser review,
  live proof failure, mobile navigation, disclosures, and no-JavaScript fallback

## Iteration 5: v0.21.0 Tool Routes and Plainer Copy

- What changed:
  - Added a tool-routes section for v0.21.0: checked input and output, verified
    callers, credentials the handler never sees, and balanced ledgers, with the
    real `toolCatalog` snippet from `examples/tools`
  - Rewrote the hero, playground, workflow, and install copy in plainer words
  - Replaced the "Partly proven" evidence grade with the measured convergence
    figure (14 of 19 first drafts, 19 of 19 end proven) from the zttp
    `docs/convergence.md`, and moved the open item to the small local model run
  - Added the startup proof check and tamper refusal to the proof carrier
  - Updated version labels and the download link to v0.21.0
- Primary metric: a visitor can name one v0.21.0 capability after scrolling past
  the workflow section
- Guardrails: no new routes, scripts, or origins; the new section reuses the
  evidence-row and first-proof styles
